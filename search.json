Football was the reason I came to Nebraska but it was cut short due to injuries. Now, I major in Sports Media and I have a minor in coaching. Coaching the more of the route I want to go because of the love and knowledge I have for the game of football. I also like to see how my teachings can help people grow into great athletes and young men."

    "text": "Coming into a professional league and performing well is hard for rookies in most sports. For NFL players, there is a lot of things that factor into a players success. The first thing would be the team they are drafted to, especially for quarterbacks. Quarterbacks are the face of the team and they have to worry about who is protecting them in games, who do they have to make plays for them, the right system to fit their play style, and who they have on defense. All these things are key to having a good rookie season. CJ Stroud is a rookie for the Houston Texans and he has been performing well with few of the things that are needed to be a succesful rookie quarterback. The texans struggle with pass protection, playmakers, and defense, yet they still have a winning record. Stroud is competing with some of the best quarterbacks and MVP candidates in just his first season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nQB2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"2019S.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed = TRUE),\n    Player = gsub(\"+\", \"\", Player, fixed = TRUE),\n    Season = 2019,\n    PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season)\n  )\n         \n  \nQB2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"2020S.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed = TRUE),\n    Player = gsub(\"+\", \"\", Player, fixed = TRUE),\n    Season = 2020,\n    PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season)\n  )\n\n\nQB2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"2021S.csv\") |&gt;\n   mutate(\n    Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed = TRUE),\n    Player = gsub(\"+\", \"\", Player, fixed = TRUE),\n    Season = 2021,\n    PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season)\n  )\n\n\nQB2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"2022S.csv\") |&gt;\n   mutate(\n    Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed = TRUE),\n    Player = gsub(\"+\", \"\", Player, fixed = TRUE),\n    Season = 2022,\n    PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season)\n  )\n\n\nQB2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"2023S.csv\") |&gt;\n   mutate(\n    Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed = TRUE),\n    Player = gsub(\"+\", \"\", Player, fixed = TRUE),\n    Season = 2023,\n    PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season)\n  )\n\nQB &lt;- bind_rows(QB2019, QB2020, QB2021, QB2022, QB2023)\n\nRQB &lt;- QB |&gt;\n  filter(Pos == \"QB\")\n\ngoodqbs &lt;- c(\"Patrick Mahomes\", \"Jalen Hurts\", \"Josh Allen\", \"Justin Herbert\")\n\ngood &lt;- RQB |&gt; filter(Player %in% goodqbs) \n\nrookielist &lt;- c(\"Kenny Pickett 2022\", \"Desmond Ridder 2022\", \"Brock Purdy 2022\", \"Sam Howel 2022\" )\n\nrookies &lt;- RQB |&gt; filter(PlayerSeason %in% rookielist)\n\ngood2023 &lt;- good |&gt; filter(Season == \"2023\")\n\nCJ &lt;- RQB |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"C.J.

The NFL’s top four MVP candidates are Jalen Hurts, Patrick Mahomes, Dak Prescott, and Lamar Jackson who all play the same position as CJ. These are also players who have been in the league much longer than he has. Also, in this list of players there are two people who have already been named NFL’s most valuable player in previous seasons. Another key part of being a succesful quarterback is scoring touchdowns without turning the ball over. Stroud also is competing against the leaugues best quarterbacks as far as touchdown to turnover ration.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = QBlong, aes(x=reorder(Player, Total), weight=Total, fill=Type)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"red\", \"green\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Player\", \n    y=\"TD vs INT\", \n    title=\"C.J.

Rather it is fumbles or interceptions it is hard making the adjustment from college to professionals because of the level of skill. Defenses are better at forcing quarterbacks into mistakes because of scemes, they are better at stripping the ball away from runners, and defenses are also a lot faster with reads and reactions. One thing people look at when they want to know if a quarterback is playing good or not is a quarterback rating. A quarterback rating is something that shows how effecient a quarterback is with completions percentage, yards, touchdowns, and interceptions. CJ is also performing well when it comes to quarterback ratings.\n\n\nCode\nTS &lt;- RQB |&gt;\n  filter(Season == \"2023\", Att &gt;= 100)\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_point(data= TS, aes(x=QBR, y=Att), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data = CJ, aes(x=QBR, y=Att), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data = good2023, aes(x=QBR, y=Att), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data = CJ, aes(x=QBR, y=Att, label=Player)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"2023 Quarterback Ratings\", \n    y=\"Attemps\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_point(data= RQB, aes(x=QBR, y=Att), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data = CJ, aes(x=QBR, y=Att), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data = good, aes(x=QBR, y=Att), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data = rookies, aes(x=QBR, y=Att), color=\"green\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data = CJ, aes(x=QBR, y=Att, label=Player)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Last 5 years of Quarterback Ratings\", \n    y=\"Attemps\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar1 + bar2 + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Stroud Compared to QB's in the Last 5 Years\",\n    subtitle = \"CJ has came a long way but still has a ways to go.\",\n    caption = \"Source:Pro Football Reference | By:John Bivens\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the 2022-2023 football season, TCU was able to put together one of the best seasons in school history, making it to the CFB playoffs and eventually making it to the national championship. They were led by their high powered offense, with quarterback Max Duggan and wide receiver Quentin Johnston. Although, TCU made it this far, they faced adversity throughout the season. Some of their biggest adversity coming from Kansas State. There were many reasons why they did not belong in the playoffs with teams like Georgia, Ohio State, and Michigan. Many thing Alabama would have been a better fit for the competition in the final four even though they lost two games. The way they were embarrassed in the national championship would lead some to believe they were the worst team to ever make it to the national championship.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nFBShips &lt;- read_csv(\"shipgames.csv\")\n\nFBShips &lt;- FBShips |&gt;\n  mutate(Margin = winPts - losePts) |&gt; \n  mutate(Label = paste(`Winner/Tie`, \"vs.\", `Loser/Tie`))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=FBShips, \n    aes(y=reorder(Label, Year), x = winPts, xend=losePts),\n    size = 5,\n    colour = \"black\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Score Differential\", \n    y=\"Championship Games\", \n    title=\"The Worst Score Margin In CFB Playoff History\", \n    subtitle=\"TCU Didn't Belong\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By John Bivens\") + \ntheme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nTCU’s defense faced adversity throughout the season, it was not just in the national championship. Their powerful offense help keep them in games but against legit teams, it is hard to depend on one side of the ball. If their defense played better in two games, TCU could have been national champions in the 2022-2023 season. The phrase, defense wins championships, was in full affect for the Horned frogs as they had one of the worst defenses in the nation.\n\n\nCode\nlog22 &lt;- read_csv(\"FBlog22.csv\")\n\nTotalYards &lt;- log22 |&gt;\n  group_by(\n    Conference, Team\n  ) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    OYards = sum(OffensiveYards),\n    DYards = sum(DefYards)\n  )\n\nB12 &lt;- TotalYards |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"Big 12 Conference\")\n\nTCU &lt;- B12 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Texas Christian\")\n\nGA &lt;- TotalYards |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"Georgia\")\n\nOH &lt;- TotalYards |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Ohio State\")\n\nMI &lt;- TotalYards |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Michigan\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data= TotalYards, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data = B12, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data = TCU, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards), color=\"#4D1979\") +\n  geom_point(data = GA, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data = OH, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data = MI, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards), color=\"#FFCB05\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data = TCU, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards, label=Team)) + \n  geom_text_repel(data = OH, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards, label=Team)) + \n  geom_text_repel(data = MI, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards, label=Team)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = GA, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards, label=Team)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Yards\", \n    y=\"Defensive Yards\", \n    title=\"TCU Gained Alot Of Yards But Gave Up More\", \n    subtitle=\"TCU's Defense Needed To Be Better\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By John Bivens\") + \ntheme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the season, the Big 12 had one of the best conferences ranking wise. They had three teams who were ranked in the college football top 25. TCU was the highest ranked team, coming in as the second ranked team in all of college football. Kansas State was ranked the 2nd highest in the Big 12, ranked 14th in the nation. Finally, the Big 12 had Texas who was ranked 25th in the country. Having three teams in the top 25 is good for any conference, but college football teams play mostly teams in their conference, so its hard to tell if they are actually good enough to compete against teams outside of their conference. With these three teams ranked in the top 25, it could be argued that the Big 12 was one of the best conferences in college football. It could also be argued that they were not.\n\n\nCode\nbowls &lt;- read_csv(\"bowls.csv\")\n\nbowllong &lt;- bowls |&gt; select(Conference, W, L) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols=-Conference, names_to=\"Outcome\", values_to=\"Total\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = bowllong, aes(x=reorder(Conference,Total), weight=Total, fill=Outcome)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"red\", \"green\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Conference\", \n    y=\"Wins & Loses\", \n    title=\"B12 Teams Lost More Bowls Than They Won\", \n    subtitle=\"The Big 12 Lost More Bowl Games Than Any Coference\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By John Bivens\") + \ntheme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )"
