    "text": "Hello, my name is John Bivens III and I am a senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I was born and raised in Dayton, Ohio where I found my love for football. Football was the reason I came to Nebraska but it was cut short due to injuries. Now, I major in Sports Media and I have a minor in coaching. Coaching the more of the route I want to go because of the love and knowledge I have for the game of football. I also like to see how my teachings can help people grow into great athletes and young men."

    "text": "In the 2022-2023 football season, TCU was able to put together one of the best seasons in school history, making it to the CFB playoffs and eventually making it to the national championship. They were led by their high powered offense, with quarterback Max Duggan and wide receiver Quentin Johnston. Although, TCU made it this far, they faced adversity throughout the season. Some of their biggest adversity coming from Kansas State. There were many reasons why they did not belong in the playoffs with teams like Georgia, Ohio State, and Michigan. Many thing Alabama would have been a better fit for the competition in the final four even though they lost two games. The way they were embarrassed in the national championship would lead some to believe they were the worst team to ever make it to the national championship.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nFBShips &lt;- read_csv(\"shipgames.csv\")\n\nFBShips &lt;- FBShips |&gt;\n  mutate(Margin = winPts - losePts) |&gt; \n  mutate(Label = paste(`Winner/Tie`, \"vs.\", `Loser/Tie`))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=FBShips, \n    aes(y=reorder(Label, Year), x = winPts, xend=losePts),\n    size = 5,\n    colour = \"black\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Score Differential\", \n    y=\"Championship Games\", \n    title=\"The Worst Score Margin In CFB Playoff History\", \n    subtitle=\"TCU Didn't Belong\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By John Bivens\") + \ntheme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nTCU’s defense faced adversity throughout the season, it was not just in the national championship. Their powerful offense help keep them in games but against legit teams, it is hard to depend on one side of the ball. If their defense played better in two games, TCU could have been national champions in the 2022-2023 season. The phrase, defense wins championships, was in full affect for the Horned frogs as they had one of the worst defenses in the nation.\n\n\nCode\nlog22 &lt;- read_csv(\"FBlog22.csv\")\n\nTotalYards &lt;- log22 |&gt;\n  group_by(\n    Conference, Team\n  ) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    OYards = sum(OffensiveYards),\n    DYards = sum(DefYards)\n  )\n\nB12 &lt;- TotalYards |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"Big 12 Conference\")\n\nTCU &lt;- B12 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Texas Christian\")\n\nGA &lt;- TotalYards |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"Georgia\")\n\nOH &lt;- TotalYards |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Ohio State\")\n\nMI &lt;- TotalYards |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Michigan\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data= TotalYards, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data = B12, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data = TCU, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards), color=\"#4D1979\") +\n  geom_point(data = GA, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data = OH, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data = MI, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards), color=\"#FFCB05\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data = TCU, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards, label=Team)) + \n  geom_text_repel(data = OH, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards, label=Team)) + \n  geom_text_repel(data = MI, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards, label=Team)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = GA, aes(x=OYards, y=DYards, label=Team)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Yards\", \n    y=\"Defensive Yards\", \n    title=\"TCU Gained Alot Of Yards But Gave Up More\", \n    subtitle=\"TCU's Defense Needed To Be Better\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By John Bivens\") + \ntheme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the season, the Big 12 had one of the best conferences ranking wise. They had three teams who were ranked in the college football top 25. TCU was the highest ranked team, coming in as the second ranked team in all of college football. Kansas State was ranked the 2nd highest in the Big 12, ranked 14th in the nation. Finally, the Big 12 had Texas who was ranked 25th in the country. Having three teams in the top 25 is good for any conference, but college football teams play mostly teams in their conference, so its hard to tell if they are actually good enough to compete against teams outside of their conference. With these three teams ranked in the top 25, it could be argued that the Big 12 was one of the best conferences in college football. It could also be argued that they were not.\n\n\nCode\nbowls &lt;- read_csv(\"bowls.csv\")\n\nbowllong &lt;- bowls |&gt; select(Conference, W, L) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols=-Conference, names_to=\"Outcome\", values_to=\"Total\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = bowllong, aes(x=reorder(Conference,Total), weight=Total, fill=Outcome)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"red\", \"green\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Conference\", \n    y=\"Wins & Loses\", \n    title=\"B12 Teams Lost More Bowls Than They Won\", \n    subtitle=\"The Big 12 Lost More Bowl Games Than Any Coference\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By John Bivens\") + \ntheme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )"
