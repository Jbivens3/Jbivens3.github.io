    "text": "Hello, my name is John Bivens III and I am a senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I was born and raised in Dayton, Ohio where I found my love for football. Football was the reason I came to Nebraska but it was cut short due to injuries. Now, I major in Sports Media and I have a minor in coaching. Coaching the more of the route I want to go because of the love and knowledge I have for the game of football. I also like to see how my teachings can help people grow into great athletes and young men."
